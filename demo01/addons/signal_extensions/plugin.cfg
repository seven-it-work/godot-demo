name="Signal Extensions"
description="This plugin extends GDScript's Signal and Callable classes, influenced by Cysharp/R3.
The main purpose of this plugin is to make it easier to unsubscribe from Godot signals. However, it is not intended to fully replicate R3.
Additionally, several simple operators are implemented."
